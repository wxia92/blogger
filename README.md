Description: 
This project is a blogger application created in Rails as part of a tutorial. The tutorial can be found here:http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html
In order to run this application, follow these steps:
1. Change the directory to the blogger folder and run the following in the command line: "bin/rails server". 
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000/" on your browser.
This application was created on Ruby 2.5, and Rails 5.2.1.

What I Learned:
I learned to create a blogging platform that would allow users to create, edit, tag, and attach images to a post. Users would be able to navigate between the articles, and the main article page. Users can also sort articles with tags.
